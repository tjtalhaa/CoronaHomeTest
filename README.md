# CoronaHomeTest
Website that take few features from user as input fields and predict their chances of getting covid based on machine learning

### Features

> Fever

> Body Pain

> Age

> RunningNose

> DifficultyBreathing

### Labels

> Probability of Covid-19

Based upon above dataset in which all the column values are generated randomly are used to predict the chances of person getting virus.
As the data is random thus results are not close to reality but I have here developed the whole prototype of system using machine learning (Logistic regression) to predict probability and with an elegant UI to the user. Whole app is light weight and responsive to almost every device.


This is a basic but working prototype for any complex system to be produce in future
